A: Yes. You can link both your Microsoft account and your Google account to the same Match Official System account.</p> <p>Q: If I forget my Microsoft/Google password, can I still access Match Official System? A: Yes. You can still sign in using your primary email and password. Then you can use the forgot password flow if needed.</p> <p>Q: Can I link the same social account to multiple Match Official System accounts? A: No. Each social account can only be linked to one Match Official System account.</p> <p>Q: Does linking an account change my password? A: No. Your primary password remains unchanged. Linking just adds another way to sign in.</p> <p>Q: What happens if I delete my Microsoft/Google account? A: You'll no longer be able to sign in using that social provider. You can still use your primary password to access Match Official System.</p> <p>Q: Is my account secure if I link social accounts? A: Yes. Linking is secure and only requires authentication from both accounts. Your data remains protected.</p> <p>Q: Can I link accounts with different email addresses? A: Your linked social account should ideally use the same email address as your Match Official System account, though the system will allow different emails. Emails will however be sent only to your primary B2C local account.</p> <p>Q: How do I know which accounts are linked? A: Go to your Profile Settings and look at the Linked Accounts section.
